This activity investigates two different aspects of free radical vinyl polymerization. In the first part (CSVP-1), students study the effects that initial monomer and initiator concentrations, termination mode, and reaction temperature have on the % conversion of monomer and the molecular weight of resulting polymer. The specific example used is the polymerization of methyl methacrylate with benzoyl peroxide. Once the initial study is completed, students are asked to determine the initial monomer and initiator concentrations required to reach 90% conversion and a molecular weight of 30,000 in 8 hours (CSVP-2). They then apply their knowledge to get the same results with a different monomer/initiator system (CSVP-3). In the second part of the activity (CSVP-4), the students investigate the composition of copolymers using reactivity ratios and the Alfrey-Price Q-e scheme. This allows the students to see the plot of percentage of monomer in polymer versus the percentage of monomer in the monomer feed for a variety of monomer combinations. This part of the activity may be used independently of Parts 1-3.

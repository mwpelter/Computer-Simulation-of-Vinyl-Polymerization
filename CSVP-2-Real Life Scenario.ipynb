    "Your assignment in the experiment illustrates the practical utility of these equations. You are now the industrial chemist in charge of making Plexiglas. You know that polymerization is an exothermic process. You also know that an exothermic reaction which releases all its energy in a short period of time is called an explosion. Consequently, you realize that the polymerization must be carried out over 8 hours so that the heat generated can be dissipated by your cooling bath as well as the surrounding air. You also know that time is money. Every hour that an operator spends over the reaction puts $100.00 in his pocket which must be added to the cost of the product to avoid bankruptcy. Yet no one will buy it if it's too expensive.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your third problem is control. You must monitor the reaction over the entire 8 hours so that if you discover that something is causing it to react faster than desired, it can be modified or terminated before it explodes. Take a few minutes to consider a solution before proceeding.\n",

    "One solution is as follows: Arbitrarily select a set of conditions and determine the conversion at 8 hours using the following equations (1) and (2). By modifying the variables and recalculating, zero in on the exact conditions necessary to achieve 90 percent conversion at 8 hours. Using equation (3), calculate the molecular weight at this point. If <30,000 repeat this process until a molecular weight >30,000 is achieved.\n",
